# Getting started

1. Go to the <a href="https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/apps">LiveChat Developers Console</a>.
2. Create a new app and follow the app wizard.
3. Set up app name, descriptions and icon in **Display** settings.
4. Configure Agent App Widget in the **Features** tab. If you don't have a working app at hand, feel free to start with the sample ones:
  * [iFrame loader](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/livechat-load-iframe?path=README.md:1:0), so you can embed any website,
  * [Visitor preview widget](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/livechat-sample-agent-app), which displays currently selected visitor data.
5. Go to **Distribution** settings and install the app at your license. You'll see it in the LiveChat Agent App.
