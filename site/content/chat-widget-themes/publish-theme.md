# Publish a theme

To publish a theme in the LiveChat Marketplace, you will need an account in the Developers Console. If you don't have it yet, create it [here](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/).

## Create a new theme

To set up a new theme in the Console, go to Apps and hit "New app". Select "Chat widget theme (just CSS)" type.

## Add custom styles

The first screen you will see after creating an app is "Features". This is where you select the base theme for your custom skin and paste your CSS code.

## Set up display options

When you move to "Display" screen, you will be able to add an icon and descriptions for your theme. 

## Distribute

Finally, you can go to "Distribution" screen to install the theme for your license or submit it for review.

## Edit a theme

To edit a published theme, you need to clone it. The copy, once reviewed and accepted, will overwrite the old version in the Marketplace. It will also automatically replace the old version of the theme for all users.

To clone a theme, go to its "Overview" screen and click "Clone this app" button.

Then proceed like normal: modify the code in "Features" section and submit the theme for review in "Distribution" screen.
