# Introduction

Moments allow you to show any web application during a chat and let customers perform specific actions.

## Is it for me?

Think about Moments as a solution for difficult tasks to handle during a conversation. When a specific task is hard to perform using text messages or it requires a lot of effort from your customer to provide requested data, Moments can make your process much more accessible. The feature allows you to solve a problem without the need to leave a chat. From a technical point of view, it's a web page embedded in an iframe shown during a chat.

<div>
    <iframe
        src="https://cdn.livechatinc.com/labs/open_chat3.html?license=100016461&group=1"
        style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); width: 100%; max-width: 300px; height: 550px; display: block; margin: 1em auto;"
    >
    </iframe>
</div>

## How it works?

1. The customer receives a rich message with the webview button
2. The customer clicks button
3. Moments show, web applications loads
4. Customer performs activities in the web application
5. The moment is closed either by:
   - Web application (method call)
   - User (close button)
