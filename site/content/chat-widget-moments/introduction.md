# Introduction

Moments allows you to show any web application during a chat, to perform custom customer actions.

## Is it for me?

Think about Moments as a solution for difficult tasks to handle during a conversation. When a specific task is hard to perform using text messages, or it requires a lot of effort from your customer to collect requested data, Moments can make your process much more accessible. It allows you to solve a problem without the need to leave a chat. From a technical point of view, it's web page embedded in iframe shown during a chat.

## How it works?

1. The customer receives a rich message with webview button
2. Customer clicks button
3. Moments shows, web applications loads
4. Customer performs activities in web application
5. The moment is closed either by:
   - Web application (method call)
   - User (close button)
