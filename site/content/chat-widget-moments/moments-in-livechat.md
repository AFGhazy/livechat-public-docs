# Moments in LiveChat

Moments can be triggered only by [rich message's](https://www.livechatinc.com/kb/rich-messages/) button. Currently, LiveChat only supports rich messages delivered by chatbots using our [ChatBot](https://chatbot.com) product. However, we are still working on other possibilities to provide rich messages to chat, such as including them inside Agent App Widgets or by using backend Chat APIs.
