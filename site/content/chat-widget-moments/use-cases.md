# Sample use cases

**Schedule meeting** - give the customer an option to choose the available term. Send a message with “choose term” button, open web application with data picker component, then send back chosen term to chat conversation as customer’s message.

**Payment system** - send customer “Pay” button, open web application with payment provider billing form, send payment id to chat after successful fulfillment.

**Seat picker** - let the customer choose a seat in stadium or restaurant. Prepare custom component with seat’s placement visualization, send back preferred option to the agent.

**Articles view** - send case-related materials from your knowledge base. Let customer quickly read them without the need of opening a new tab.

Moments let you embed almost every web application in chat widget, but it shouldn’t be treated as a place to surf the web. Moments should allow a customer to focus on a particular task, complete it in a straightforward way and back to the chat. You shouldn’t redirect the customer to the complex web application with multiple views, complicated forms or web.
