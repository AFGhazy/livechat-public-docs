# Introduction

The LiveChat Widget for iOS allows the app users to contact the chat agents directly from a mobile application. The widget is very easy for developers to integrate into their existing iOS apps. 

The source code and installation instructions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/livechat/chat-window-ios).

Version 2.0 of the widget has several significant improvements over the previous version that 
can be found [here](https://github.com/livechat/chat-window-ios/tree/e615b6e10848ece7c255407a6fff8485a92700aa).
