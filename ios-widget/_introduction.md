# Introduction

LiveChat Widget for iOS allows app users to contact support directly from the mobile application. The widget is very easy for developers to integrate into their existing iOS apps. Source code and installation instructions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/livechat/chat-window-ios).

Version 2.0 of the widget has several significant improvements over the previous version that
