# Advanced use

## Sample extensions

We've prepared two example repositories for your convenience. Both examples show how to receive data from [Events](#events) and display them within the sidebar.

You can take it from there and use the visitor's email to query your own service or provide contextual help for the agent based on visitor details.

### PHP & Silex

> Set up the environment

```shell
git clone https://github.com/livechat/agent-app-sample-extension.git
cd agent-app-sample-extension
composer install
```

> Configure your local web server to serve content over HTTPS and [turn on the extension](#turn-on-the-extension).

A basic backend application example written with the use of [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/).

### Webpack (JS)

> Set up the environment

```shell
git clone https://github.com/livechat/agent-app-sample-extension-webpack.git
cd agent-app-sample-extension-webpack
npm install
```

> Run the webpack server

```
npm start
```

A basic static application example served from [Webpack Server](https://webpack.github.io/).

<a class="button green" href="https://github.com/livechat/agent-app-sample-extension-webpack" target="_blank"><span>GitHub Repository</span></a>

> The content of the extension should be available at [https://localhost:3333](https://localhost:3333).

> You can now [turn on the extension](#turn-on-the-extension).

## Hosting the extension

You can host your extension locally or on a dedicated server. The hosted content has to be served over **HTTPS Protocol**. You can use a self-signed certificate for `localhost` or upload your extension to an SSL-enabled host. If you go for the [Webpack Example](#webpack-js), you'll get the setup out of-the-box.

## Developing your own extension

If you want to build your own extension, be sure to include both the [LiveChat Boilerplate](/boilerplate) and [JavaScript Extension API](#javascript-api):

> Place this tag within the `<head></head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.livechatinc.com/boilerplate/1.1.css">
<script src="//cdn.livechatinc.com/boilerplate/1.1.js"></script>
```

After your extension content is loaded, fire the `LiveChat.init()` method. It will let the Agent App know when to hide the spinning loader.

> Fire `LiveChat.init()` method after body is loaded (e.g. using jQuery):

```js
// If you authorize using "Basic authorization flow":
$(document).ready(function () {
    LiveChat.init();
});

// If you authorize using "Sign in with LiveChat":
$(document).ready(function () {
    LiveChat.init({
      authorize: false
    });
});
```

## Layout & Styling

We ship a [LiveChat Boilerplate](/boilerplate) â€“ it's a lightweight CSS stylesheet to help you lift off with creating the extension interface.
